Based on the provided screenshots, the UI/UX of the Titan Fleet mobile site is highly focused on utilitarianism and trust-building. It successfully avoids the "over-designed" look of many corporate platforms in favor of a layout that feels accessible to people actually working in the transport industry.
📱 User Interface (UI) Analysis
 * High Contrast Readability: The interface uses bold, dark typography on a clean white background, which is essential for drivers or managers viewing the screen in varied lighting conditions, such as inside a truck cab.
 * Professional Color Palette: The primary use of Titan Blue conveys reliability, while the "Early Access" green provides a modern, high-visibility accent that doesn't overwhelm the user.
 * Role-Based Visuals: The site uses photography to clearly delineate sections for the Fleet Owner, Transport Manager, and HGV Driver, helping users immediately find the content most relevant to their professional needs.
 * Functional Iconography: Simple, recognizable icons are used for features like Live GPS Tracking (satellite dish) and Proof of Delivery (package), allowing for quick mental processing while scrolling.
🛠️ User Experience (UX) Analysis
 * Sticky Conversion Points: The header remains fixed at the top, keeping Driver/Manager Logins and the "View demo" button always within reach, which is great for user retention.
 * Feature-Benefit Pairing: Instead of just listing technical specs, the UX focuses on outcomes, such as pairing DVSA-Ready Compliance with the emotional benefit of "Sleep at night compliance".
 * Transparent Pricing Friction Reduction: The pricing section includes a slider and clear plan cards (Starter, Growth, Pro, Scale), allowing users to self-qualify their fleet size and cost without needing to contact sales first.
 * Personalization and Trust: Including a photo of the founder, Jon, and a direct "Call Jon" button significantly reduces the perceived barrier between the customer and the company.
💡 Potential UX Refinements
 * Pricing Card Length: On mobile, the pricing cards (like the Starter plan) are quite long. You might consider a "Compare Features" toggle or accordion to reduce the amount of scrolling required to reach the "Start Free Trial" buttons.
 * Secondary Button Visibility: The "See how it works" button uses an outline style. While it looks clean, ensure it has enough visual weight to be seen clearly in bright sunlight.
Would you like me to take a look at the "View Demo" portal to see if the internal dashboard maintains this same level of clarity for active users?
