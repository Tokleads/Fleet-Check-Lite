Not for v1 — unless you’re actively selling into **big fleets with corporate IT** who will block you without it.

Here’s the truth behind that FleetCheck line:

## What they mean by “OAuth 2.0 SSO”

* **OAuth 2.0** is an *authorisation* protocol (sign in with Google/Microsoft, etc.).
* “**SSO**” in B2B usually means **SAML/Enterprise SSO** (Microsoft Entra ID/Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace) where IT controls access centrally.
* Vendors often say “OAuth SSO” because it sounds enterprise-grade, but it’s not always the same as **true enterprise SSO**.

## Should Titan Fleet build it?

### Build later (recommended)

For most UK operators (small–mid), what they actually care about is:

* roles/permissions (driver vs manager)
* audit trail
* 2FA
* secure logins, PINs, device controls
* clean access offboarding

SSO only becomes a “must-have” when:

* the customer has **IT/security policy**
* they require **Entra ID/Okta**
* they want enforced MFA + central user management
* they ask about **SCIM** provisioning (auto-create/disable accounts)

If you’re targeting owner-operators and SMEs with “pay once, own forever”, SSO is **nice-to-have** not deal-critical.

## What you *should* build first (better ROI than SSO)

1. **2FA / MFA** for manager/admin accounts (TOTP app)
2. **Role-based access control** (Driver / Supervisor / TM / Admin)
3. **Audit logs** (who changed what, when)
4. **Session security** (short-lived tokens, refresh, device logout)
5. **Password policy + lockout** / optional magic-link login

These are the things that *feel* “enterprise” to buyers and protect you legally.

## A smart compromise: “SSO-ready” without building enterprise SSO now

* Add a roadmap line: **“Enterprise SSO available on Major Operator plan (by request)”**
* Implement **Microsoft + Google login** (OAuth) for Admins as an optional login method later — easier than full SAML.
* When you actually need enterprise SSO, do **SAML** (Entra ID/Okta) + optional **SCIM** for the largest customers.

## How to position it on the site right now

Instead of claiming it, say something like:

* **“2FA, role-based access, audit logs”**
* **“Enterprise SSO available for larger operators (Entra ID/Okta) — ask during onboarding.”**

That reads premium without you burning weeks building something 95% of customers won’t use.

If you tell me what stack you’re on (Next.js? Supabase? Firebase? Clerk/Auth0?), I’ll tell you the cleanest path for “SSO-ready now, enterprise SSO later” with minimal rebuild.
