Paste this **entire prompt** into Replit Agent. It’s written to **upgrade UI/UX to “£50k product feel” without changing core logic**, and it forces the agent to produce a **polish pass + design system + component states + microcopy** across your existing screens.

## ✅ REPLIT MEGA PROMPT — “£50k UI Polish Pass” (Driver App)

You are a principal product designer + senior frontend engineer (React/TS/Tailwind/shadcn/Radix/Framer Motion) hired to do a **surgical premium UI/UX polish pass** on an existing UK HGV driver PWA. **Do NOT change core logic, routes, data model, or backend behaviour.** Only improve presentation, interaction, states, typography, spacing, motion, and microcopy.

### Project context

* App: UK HGV Fleet Driver App (PWA) for vehicle inspections + fuel/AdBlue capture + defect reporting.
* Competitor: FleetCheck (must feel more premium).
* Users: HGV drivers (glove-friendly, fast, low cognitive load), transport managers (professional outputs).
* Stack: React + TypeScript + Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/Radix, custom “Titan UI” components, Framer Motion, Express + Postgres.
* Constraint: **Driver-first UI.** Drivers should not see manager-style login/role selection screens. Driver access is via **Company Code + Driver PIN** (simple, fast).

### Screens already implemented (do not remove)

1. Driver Home/Dashboard
2. Vehicle Search + Recent vehicles
3. Vehicle Actions (Start Inspection, Fuel/AdBlue, Report Defect)
4. Trailer attached dialog (Yes/No)
5. Check type selection (End of shift / Safety check + trailer-only toggle)
6. Safety Check screen:

   * Sticky header, progress bar
   * Odometer input card
   * Collapsible sections (Lights, Exterior, Tyres & Wheels, In Cab, Fluids & Mechanical, Load & Security + Trailer sections when applicable)
   * Tap = Pass (green)
   * Long-press (500ms) = Fail → opens defect bottom sheet
   * Defect bottom sheet: description + photo capture + optional additional photo slots
   * Floating submit button with dynamic label

### What to build (deliverables)

You will perform an **App-wide UI/UX refinement pass** and produce:

1. **A unified premium design system** (tokens, typography scale, spacing scale, radii, shadows, borders).
2. **Component standards**: buttons, inputs, cards, lists, modals, bottom sheets, nav bar, progress.
3. **State polish**: hover/active/pressed/focus/disabled/loading/skeleton/empty/error states for each screen.
4. **Motion system**: subtle and intentional, using Framer Motion. Remove any over-animation. Add micro-interactions that increase perceived quality.
5. **Microcopy pass** using UK haulage terminology: VRM, mileage, defect, trailer coupled, end of shift inspection, etc.
6. **Accessibility + mobile ergonomics**: thumb zones, 56px tap targets, high contrast, readable type, reduced motion support.

### Non-negotiable quality bar

Make it feel like a **£50k UI**:

* crisp hierarchy (titles vs labels vs metadata)
* consistent spacing rhythm
* restrained colour usage (primary colour for actions only)
* premium shadows + borders (no “default Tailwind look”)
* correct empty/skeleton states
* clear touch feedback on every tap
* long-press affordance with a subtle visual “hold” indicator (premium)

### Hard constraints

* DO NOT change backend APIs.
* DO NOT rewrite data fetching logic.
* DO NOT remove features.
* DO NOT introduce heavy libraries beyond what exists (Tailwind/shadcn/Radix/Framer Motion ok).
* Keep performance fast on low-end phones.
* Keep layouts mobile-first; ensure desktop still looks clean.

# Implementation plan you must follow

## Step A — Audit and map current UI

* Identify existing UI components and where styles are inconsistent.
* Locate where Tailwind classes are duplicated or inconsistent.
* Output a short “before” map in comments.

## Step B — Create “Titan Design Tokens”

Create/update a single source of truth for styling:

* Use CSS variables in `src/styles/globals.css` (or equivalent) and map into Tailwind config.
* Add tokens for:

  * colours: background/surface/elevated/text-muted/border/primary/success/warn/danger
  * radii: sm/md/lg/xl
  * shadow: 1/2/3 (premium soft)
  * spacing rhythm: 4/8/12/16/24/32
  * typography scale: display/title/section/body/meta/micro
* Ensure dark mode compatibility (even if UI is light-first).

## Step C — Typography system (must implement)

* Default font: Inter for UI.
* Headings: Oswald for screen titles only (optional fallback to Inter if not loaded).
* Enforce hierarchy with Tailwind utilities/classes:

  * Screen title: text-xl font-medium tracking-tight leading-tight
  * Section label (uppercase meta): text-xs font-semibold tracking-widest text-muted-foreground
  * Card title: text-base font-semibold
  * Body: text-sm font-normal
  * Microcopy: text-xs text-muted-foreground
* Replace “everything bold” with correct weights.

## Step D — Component polish (must implement)

Implement/upgrade these components in your Titan library (or add if missing):

1. `TitanCard`
2. `TitanHeader` (sticky with title + back + meta line)
3. `TitanSearchBar` (VRM input + search button with proper focus/active/disabled)
4. `TitanListItem` (chevron, icon, subtitle)
5. `TitanSectionAccordion` (collapsible section header with progress)
6. `TitanCheckItem` (tap pass / hold defect)
7. `TitanBottomSheet` (defect reporting)
8. `TitanFAB` (floating submit button)
9. `TitanSkeleton` (loading state)
10. `TitanEmptyState`

All components must have:

* pressed state (scale 0.98 + subtle shadow change)
* focus-visible rings
* disabled styling
* loading spinner or skeleton
* consistent padding: 16 on cards, 12 on list items, 24 screen gutters top sections

## Step E — Motion rules (Framer Motion)

* Use restrained spring motion: stiffness 380, damping 32
* Only animate:

  * accordion open/close
  * progress bar updates
  * bottom sheet open/close
  * tap/press feedback (small scale)
* Add premium micro-interaction:

  * Long-press hold indicator: show a circular/radial progress around the check icon during the 500ms hold.
  * Haptic tick on pass/fail (navigator.vibrate 10ms) if available.
* Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

## Step F — Microcopy pass (UK haulage)

Update labels without changing meaning:

* “Enter VRM” → “Enter VRM (e.g., KX65ABC)”
* “Odometer” → “Mileage (miles)”
* “Tap: Pass · Hold: Report fault” → “Tap to pass · Hold to log defect”
* “Trailer attached?” → “Trailer coupled?” / “Is a trailer currently coupled?”
* “Choose check type” → “Select inspection type”
* Empty states should be helpful and professional.

## Step G — Screen-by-screen final polish

### Driver Home

* Improve hierarchy and whitespace.
* Make search primary. Recent vehicles as cards.
* Add clear empty state.

### Vehicle Actions

* Ensure the top vehicle identity card never looks blank: VRM, make/model, MOT status badge, last check time.

### Trailer dialog

* Make it fast: two large buttons, clear microcopy, no unnecessary text.

### Check type

* Card list with proper spacing and subtle dividers.

### Safety Check

* Keep sticky header and progress.
* Odometer card should not overpower; balance contrast.
* Section headers show icon + title + “x/y checked”.
* Check items:

  * tap = pass (emerald)
  * long press = defect (red) opens bottom sheet
  * show current state clearly (passed/defect/unset)
* FAB:

  * dynamic label (“Submit inspection”, “Continue”, “Fix 2 defects”, etc.)
  * disable until required fields complete
* Add skeletons when loading checksheet.

## Step H — Output requirements

When finished:

1. Ensure code compiles.
2. Run formatting/lint if available.
3. Provide a concise summary of what changed.
4. List the key token values and component API.

---

# Acceptance tests

* UI feels premium, calm, consistent.
* All tap targets ≥ 56px on mobile.
* Every interactive element has pressed feedback.
* Long-press shows hold indicator and then opens defect sheet.
* No logic or API behaviour changed.
* App is rebrandable: colours + logo driven by config/tokens.

Now implement this polish pass in the repository.
