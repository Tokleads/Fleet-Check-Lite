Single scroll list is **better than a multi-page form** for speed (drivers can just smash through it)… **but only if you add structure**. Right now it’ll feel “endless” and easy to miss items.

What I’d do (so it beats FleetCheck):

* **Keep it one scroll**, but **group into collapsible sections** (Tyres / Lights / Cab / Fluids / Coupling / Load / Walkaround / Defects) with a **sticky progress bar** + “X of Y done”.
* Each check row is **tap once = Pass**, long-press or “…” = **Fail + requires photo + notes**.
* **Pinned “Must capture” block** near the top: Odometer + fuel/adblue receipts (when relevant) + fuel card photo.
* **Smart defaults** (last vehicle, last odometer shown as hint, last fuel location suggestion).
* **Offline-first queue**: complete at the yard with no signal → auto-upload later.

## Copy/paste Replit “MEGA PROMPT” (Driver App only — premium UX, rebrandable, no vendor lock-in storage)

Paste this into Replit Agent. It is written to force **high-end UI/UX**, **clean architecture**, **multi-tenant rebrand**, and **Google Drive as the storage destination** (so you don’t “hold” customer data long term).

> **PROMPT START**
>
> You are an industry-leading product + engineering team building a **premium Driver Mobile Web App (PWA)** for UK HGV fleets. It must feel **more polished than FleetCheck**: fast, minimal taps, strong hierarchy, modern motion, excellent spacing/typography, and “glove-friendly” controls.
>
> ## Product name (internal)
>
> “DriverChecks Pro” (must be easy to rebrand per customer).
>
> ## Goal
>
> Build the **Driver-facing app only** (mobile-first PWA). Managers use their own Google Drive for storage and can later get a separate desktop portal (not in this build).
>
> ## Key driver workflows (must nail)
>
> 1. **Start Shift Check (Daily walkaround)**
> 2. **End of Shift Check** (optional quick)
> 3. **Fuel / AdBlue Purchase Capture** (critical)
> 4. **Defect Report** (with required photos)
> 5. **Vehicle search by registration** (like FleetCheck: type reg → press search → select vehicle)
> 6. **History (last 7 days on device)** + cloud copies in Google Drive
> 7. **Offline mode** with upload queue
>
> ## Hard constraints
>
> * Drivers should NOT see a “choose company & role” desktop-style screen. Driver app should open straight into **Driver Home** after a simple sign-in (PIN or magic link) OR demo mode.
> * **No long-term data storage operated by us.** App uploads completed forms + images to the customer’s **Google Drive** (their account). We can keep only minimal metadata needed for syncing (or allow fully stateless mode if desired).
> * Company policy: **do not require price** for fuel/adblue (field may exist but must be optional and hidden by default via config).
> * Photos required: fuel receipt photo, fuel card photo, and optionally adblue receipt photo; plus defect photos on fails.
> * Must be rebrandable per customer using a single config file (logo, colors, company name, required fields, form templates).
>
> ## Tech requirements (use these)
>
> * Frontend: **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript**
> * UI: Tailwind + a high-quality component approach (Radix/shadcn OK) but must look premium and custom (not default).
> * State: React Query (or equivalent) + Zod for validation.
> * PWA: installable, offline caching, background sync-like queue (simulate if needed).
> * Backend: minimal Next.js route handlers (or Express) ONLY for:
>
>   * auth (simple)
>   * Google Drive OAuth + upload proxy
>   * optional vehicle lookup via DVLA/MOT API (behind environment variables; stub if keys not present)
> * Storage: Use Google Drive:
>
>   * Create folder structure: /DriverChecksPro/{Company}/{VehicleReg}/{YYYY}/{MM}/
>   * Each submission creates:
>
>     * JSON summary (machine readable)
>     * PDF “Driver Check Sheet” (print-friendly)
>     * Photos uploaded with sensible filenames
> * Security:
>
>   * No public buckets. No exposing Google refresh tokens to client. Use server-side token handling.
>   * Basic audit fields: driverId, timestamp, deviceId, gps optional toggle.
>
> ## UX rules (non-negotiable)
>
> * Mobile-first. Large tap targets. Bottom nav with 4 tabs: **Home, Checks, Capture, History, Settings** (5 ok).
> * **Progressive disclosure**: avoid a giant endless list. Use sections that collapse/expand with completion indicators.
> * “Tap to check” becomes:
>
>   * Tap = Pass (instant)
>   * Tap again = unset
>   * Long-press or overflow menu = Fail → open a bottom sheet that requires: severity, notes, 1–3 photos
> * A sticky footer CTA appears when needed:
>
>   * “Continue” when a section incomplete
>   * “Submit check” when all required complete
> * Inline validation: odometer must be numeric and within reasonable delta vs last known (warn, don’t block).
> * Offline: if no signal, allow full completion, store locally, show “Queued” badge, auto-upload later.
> * Make it feel premium: subtle shadows, soft borders, spacing, skeleton loading, micro-animations, empty states.
>
> ## Core data model
>
> * CompanyConfig (theme + rules)
> * Vehicle: { reg, make?, model?, fleetNo?, lastOdometer? }
> * Driver: { id, name?, pinAuth? }
> * CheckTemplate:
>
>   * sections[] each with items[]; each item has { id, label, type: passFail | photoOnly | text | number }
> * Submission:
>
>   * { id, companyId, vehicleReg, driverId, type: startShift|endShift|fuel|defect, createdAt, status: draft|queued|uploaded, payload, photos[] }
>
> ## Screens to implement
>
> 1. **Driver Home**
>
> * “Start Safety Check” (primary)
> * “Fuel / AdBlue Capture”
> * “Report Defect”
> * “Last vehicle used” quick resume
> * Status chip: Online / Offline + queued count
>
> 2. **Vehicle Search**
>
> * reg input + SEARCH button (no auto lookup until press)
> * results list (exact + partial)
> * select vehicle → continue
>
> 3. **Safety Check (premium)**
>
> * top card: date/time + vehicle + driver
> * required field: odometer
> * collapsible sections with progress
> * pass/fail interactions described above
> * defect block only appears if any fails
> * submit creates PDF + JSON + uploads
>
> 4. **Fuel / AdBlue Capture**
>
> * required: location, odometer, litres, date (default today), fuel type (diesel default)
> * optional/hidden by config: price
> * required photos: fuel receipt + fuel card photo
> * adblue toggle:
>
>   * if enabled, capture litres + receipt photo (fuel card photo can be reused)
>
> 5. **History**
>
> * local last 7 days list with filters (vehicle, type)
> * each item shows status: uploaded/queued
>
> 6. **Settings**
>
> * company branding preview
> * offline storage size
> * sign out
> * demo mode toggle
>
> ## Rebranding / multi-tenant
>
> * Create `/config/tenants.ts` with at least 2 sample companies.
> * Tenant selected by subdomain or query param `?tenant=apex` for now.
> * Theme tokens: primary, accent, background, text, radius, shadow scale.
> * Must support “required photos” & “hide price field” in config.
>
> ## Vehicle data + MOT API
>
> * Implement a Vehicle lookup service that can:
>
>   * (A) use an internal seeded list for demo
>   * (B) if env `MOT_API_KEY` is present, call a server route to fetch vehicle basics by reg (do NOT block if unavailable; fall back gracefully)
>
> ## Deliverables
>
> * Complete running Replit project
> * Clear README:
>
>   * how to set tenant
>   * how to connect Google Drive OAuth (step-by-step)
>   * env vars list
> * Seed demo data: 45 vehicles sample regs (dummy), 3 drivers
> * Make the UI polished. If anything looks “default template”, redo it.
>
> ## Acceptance criteria
>
> * A driver can complete a safety check in under 2 minutes with minimal taps.
> * Fuel capture forces receipt + fuel card photo before submit.
> * Offline completion works; queued submissions upload when back online.
> * Rebrand by editing one tenant config file.
>
> Build it now. Start by scaffolding the project, then implement the core flows, then refine UI/UX to premium quality.
>
> **PROMPT END**
>
> **(After build)** create a short “UX polish checklist” in the README and apply it.

If you want, paste me the Replit build output / repo structure after it runs, and I’ll give you a **surgical “make it feel like £50k UI” punch list** (spacing, typography scale, component states, motion, microcopy) without changing your core logic.
