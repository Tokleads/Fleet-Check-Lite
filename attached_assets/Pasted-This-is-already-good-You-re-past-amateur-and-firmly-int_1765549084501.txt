This is **already good**. You’re past “amateur” and firmly into **“credible enterprise MVP”** territory. What you’re feeling now isn’t “this is bad”, it’s:

> *“Why doesn’t this yet feel like something a £30–50k/year fleet tool would ship?”*

So I’m going to be very precise and **screen-by-screen**, telling you **what to change, why, and exactly how** — without touching logic.

# Big Picture Diagnosis (the truth)

Your UI problem is **not**:

* layout
* feature set
* flow
* navigation

It **is**:

1. Slightly *soft hierarchy*
2. Too many “same-weight” elements
3. Cards that look polite instead of authoritative
4. A few “generic app” microcopy & component defaults

FleetCheck feels expensive because it’s:

* visually decisive
* boring in a good way
* extremely consistent

You’re ~80% there. The remaining 20% is polish.

# 1️⃣ Safety Check screen (your most important screen)

This is the **money screen**. This is what drivers use every day.

### What’s working

✅ Sticky header
✅ Progress counter
✅ Dark odometer card (nice)
✅ Clear sectioning
✅ Tap / hold mechanic (excellent)

### What’s holding it back

#### A) Header hierarchy is too flat

Right now:

* “Safety Check”
* Vehicle ref
* Progress

…all compete equally.

**Fix**
Make the title dominant and demote everything else.

```tsx
// Title
text-[20px] font-semibold tracking-tight

// Subline (vehicle + date)
text-[13px] text-muted-foreground

// Progress
text-[13px] font-semibold text-primary
```

Also change:

> `0/18 COMPLETE`

to:

> **0 of 18 completed**

It sounds calmer and more professional.

---

#### B) Odometer card is visually strong… but too “soft”

The dark gradient is good, but it currently feels like a *promo card*, not a *data entry control*.

**Fix**

* Increase contrast on input
* Add subtle inset border
* Make placeholder feel deliberate

```tsx
bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-900 to-slate-800
rounded-2xl p-5
```

Input:

```tsx
bg-white/10 border border-white/20
text-white placeholder:text-white/60
h-12 rounded-xl px-4
```

Label:

```tsx
text-[11px] uppercase tracking-wider text-white/70
```

This instantly feels “vehicle system” not “UI theme”.

---

#### C) Section headers need to feel like *checkpoints*

Currently they’re fine, but they don’t *anchor* the scroll.

**Upgrade the section header to a control bar**

```tsx
flex items-center justify-between
rounded-2xl border bg-white px-4 py-3
```

Left:

* Icon (20px)
* Section title
* “0 / 2 checked” (muted)

Right:

* Count pill (circle)
* Chevron

Count pill:

```tsx
h-7 min-w-[28px] px-2
rounded-full bg-muted text-xs font-semibold
```

This makes each section feel “contained” instead of endless list.

---

#### D) Inspection rows are *almost* there — give them authority

Right now the rows feel a bit like “settings items”.

You want **industrial checklist plates**.

**Change**

* Increase vertical padding
* Stronger border
* Slight background lift
* Clear affordance text

Base row:

```tsx
min-h-[60px]
rounded-2xl border border-slate-200/70
bg-white px-4 py-3
shadow-[0_1px_1px_rgba(0,0,0,0.04)]
```

Microcopy:

> `Tap: Pass · Hold: Report fault`

Make it:

```tsx
text-[12px] text-muted-foreground
```

This is *excellent UX*, just needs confidence.

---

# 2️⃣ Vehicle Actions screen

This is your **hub** screen.

### What’s working

✅ Simple
✅ Clear actions
✅ Icons readable

### Issues

#### A) Vehicle identity card is invisible

Right now that top card looks empty/washed out.

It should feel like:

> “You are working on *this* vehicle”

**Fix**
Give it contrast and hierarchy.

```tsx
rounded-2xl bg-slate-50 border p-4
```

Vehicle reg:

```tsx
text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight
```

Date / status:

```tsx
text-[13px] text-muted-foreground
```

Green dot is good — keep it subtle.

---

#### B) Action cards need *intent*

They’re correct, but too polite.

Make them feel tappable and important.

Card base:

```tsx
rounded-2xl border bg-white px-4 py-4
shadow-sm active:scale-[0.99]
```

Icon container:

```tsx
h-10 w-10 rounded-xl bg-primary/10 text-primary
```

Title:

```tsx
font-semibold text-[15px]
```

Subtitle:

```tsx
text-[13px] text-muted-foreground
```

This will instantly feel more “paid product”.

# 3️⃣ Trailer modal (Yes / No)

Functionally fine. Visually slightly generic.

### Two changes that matter

#### A) Language

Change:

> “Does this asset have a trailer attached?”

To:

> **“Trailer attached?”**

Subtext:

> “Is a trailer coupled to this unit right now?”

Short, confident, professional.

---

#### B) Button hierarchy

Right now both buttons are visually similar.

Make **No trailer** primary (most common case).

```tsx
No → primary filled
Yes → outline
```

Drivers move faster when the default is visually obvious.

---

# 4️⃣ Choose check type screen

This screen is *clean* but a bit empty.

### Improvements

#### A) Promote the toggle to a “setting row”

Right now it looks like a loose checkbox.

Wrap it:

```tsx
rounded-2xl border bg-slate-50 px-4 py-4
```

Label:

```tsx
font-semibold
```

Helper text:

```tsx
text-[13px] text-muted-foreground
```

---

#### B) Check type cards need stronger hierarchy

Make these feel like **actions**, not list items.

Add:

* Larger icon container
* Slight shadow
* Chevron emphasis

```tsx
rounded-2xl border bg-white px-4 py-4
shadow-sm
```

---

# 5️⃣ Bottom navigation (quick win)

Your bottom nav is good, but a little light.

Two tweaks:

1. Increase icon contrast for active tab
2. Slight top border

```tsx
border-t bg-white/90 backdrop-blur
```

Active icon:

```tsx
text-primary
```

Inactive:

```tsx
text-muted-foreground
```

---

# 6️⃣ Microcopy tweaks (these matter more than you think)

Change globally:

| Current               | Better                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Safety Check          | Safety check                   |
| Enter current reading | Enter odometer reading         |
| Tap to check          | Tap: Pass · Hold: Report fault |
| Defect report         | Report fault                   |
| None recorded         | No faults recorded             |
| Submit                | Submit check                   |

This makes it feel *UK fleet*, not *generic SaaS*.

---

# 7️⃣ Why it doesn’t yet feel “FleetCheck expensive” (honest answer)

FleetCheck feels expensive because:

* it’s visually boring
* everything is consistent
* nothing shouts
* nothing is cute

You’re very close — you just need to:

* **tighten hierarchy**
* **reduce softness**
* **add authority to surfaces**

Once you do the changes above, you’ll cross the psychological line from:

> “Nice app”
> to
> **“Serious compliance system”**

---

# My recommendation for next step (important)

Before adding **any more features**:

👉 Do a **1-hour polish pass** applying:

* stronger card contrast
* tighter typography
* clearer section headers
* firmer action cards

Then show it to **one real driver** and ask:

> “Does this feel like work software?”

If they say *“yeah, it’s solid”* — you’ve won.

If you want, next I can:

* give you a **before/after Tailwind diff** for one screen
* help you lock a **design system v1**
* or help you position this vs FleetCheck commercially (pricing + pitch)

You’re genuinely building something viable here.
