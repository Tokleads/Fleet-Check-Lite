Yep — what you’ve got is “clean”, but it reads as **default SaaS template** (flat card, generic spacing, weak hierarchy). FleetCheck feels higher quality because it nails 4 things: **typography system, depth/layers, component polish, and micro-interaction**.

Here’s how to get yours to that level, fast.

## What’s making your screen look “cheap” (and how to fix it)

### 1) Typography + hierarchy (biggest win)

Right now everything is similar weight/size, so it feels bland.

* Use a **modern UI font** (Inter / SF / Plus Jakarta / Manrope).
* Make the headline either **smaller + tighter** (more “product”) or **bigger + bolder** (more “brand”) — not in the middle.
* Add a real type scale:

  * H1 36–44 / semibold
  * H2 18–20 / medium
  * Body 14–16 / regular
  * Labels 12–13 / medium (uppercase optional)

### 2) Depth + surfaces (FleetCheck “feels” expensive)

Your card shadow/border is too subtle and everything sits on one plane.

* Add a **soft background gradient** (not pure grey).
* Use layered surfaces:

  * Page background: subtle gradient
  * Card: white with **stronger shadow + slightly darker border**
  * Inputs: slightly tinted background, not pure white

Example direction:

* Card: `border: 1px solid rgba(15,23,42,.08)`
* Shadow: `0 20px 60px rgba(15,23,42,.10)` + `0 2px 8px rgba(15,23,42,.06)`

### 3) Components: make them “touchable”

Your role tiles look like plain divs.

* Make “Driver/Manager” a **segmented control** or **select cards** with:

  * hover lift (`translateY(-1px)`)
  * selected state: subtle tint + border + checkmark
  * focus ring that matches brand

Also: your dropdown looks default. Upgrade it:

* Larger hit area (48–52px height)
* Clear caret icon, better padding
* Placeholder + helper text + error state

### 4) Spacing + alignment

FleetCheck uses a strict grid.

* Use an **8px spacing system** only (8/16/24/32/40).
* Tighten vertical whitespace above the card (your hero area is too tall).
* Keep max width ~ **440–480px** for the login card (yours is a bit wide/loose).

### 5) Micro-interactions (instant “premium”)

* Button: press animation + loading state
* Dropdown: smooth open, search inside
* Role selection: animated highlight
* Page load: subtle fade-in

## The exact UI direction I’d give Replit (copy/paste prompt)

Paste this into Replit Agent **as a new instruction** (it will refactor your UI):

**Prompt: Premium UI/UX Refactor (FleetCheck-level polish)**
Build the login/role selection screen to feel like a premium enterprise mobile-first product (FleetCheck quality). Implement a design system and refactor the existing UI accordingly.

**Design requirements**

* Use a modern UI font (Inter preferred). Establish a type scale and apply it consistently.
* Use an 8px spacing grid everywhere.
* Create design tokens (CSS variables):
  `--bg`, `--surface`, `--surface-2`, `--text`, `--muted`, `--border`, `--primary`, `--primary-foreground`, `--radius`, `--shadow`.
* Add a subtle background gradient and layered surfaces (page background ≠ card ≠ inputs).
* Add consistent focus rings and hover/pressed states (keyboard accessible).
* Cards and inputs must look “touchable”: 48–52px controls, generous padding, clean borders, premium shadows.

**Component improvements**

* Replace role selection with a proper “select card group” component:

  * two tiles Driver/Manager
  * hover lift
  * selected state (tinted background + border + check icon)
  * accessible radio semantics
* Company selector:

  * searchable dropdown
  * clear empty state + loading state
  * consistent spacing and typography
* Primary CTA button:

  * full-width, 52px height
  * loading spinner + disabled state
  * subtle press animation

**Layout requirements**

* Centered login panel max width 460px.
* Reduce excessive top whitespace; logo + title block should be tighter and balanced.
* Ensure perfect alignment and consistent vertical rhythm (no arbitrary gaps).

**Deliverables**

* Update the UI components, tokens, and styles.
* Keep functionality identical; only upgrade UX + visual polish.
* Provide a reusable `ThemeProvider` / tokens file so future pages match this standard.

## If you want it to match FleetCheck even closer

Two extra “FleetCheck-like” touches:

1. **Hero image header strip** (very faint road/warehouse blur) behind the top area
2. **Icon style consistency**: same stroke width, same size, same colour rules (muted when inactive)

If you show me **one screenshot of FleetCheck’s sign-in screen** you’re trying to match (or link), I’ll give you a pixel-level spec: exact spacing, font sizes, shadows, and the component recipe to replicate it.
